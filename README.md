## ✅ Key Concepts Demonstrated

The submitted queries cover all required aggregation and grouping concepts:

**Aggregate Functions:** Used `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` to perform calculations across data sets.
**Grouping:** Employed **`GROUP BY`** to categorize results (e.g., counting orders per customer).
**Filtering Groups:** Utilized **`HAVING`** to filter the results of a grouped aggregation (e.g., finding customers with total spending over a threshold).
 **Joins:** Included a join between the `Products` and `Order_Items` tables to calculate sales metrics per product.
